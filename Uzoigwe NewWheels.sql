-- [1] To begin with the project, you need to create the database first
-- Write the Query below to create a Database
CREATE DATABASE vehdb;--Here, we are creating a database called 'vehdb'.

-- [2] Now, after creating the database, you need to tell MYSQL which database is to be used.
-- Write the Query below to call your Database
USE vehdb; --Here, we are selecting the name of the database to be used and making it the default database to be used by mysql workbench, in this case vehdb is made the default database

-- [3] Creating the tables:

/*Note:
---> To create the table, refer to the ER diagram and the solution architecture.Â 
---> Refer to the column names along with the data type while creating a table from the ER diagram.
---> If needed revisit the videos Week 2: Data Modeling and Architecture: Creating DDLs for Your Main Dataset and Normalized Datasets
---> While creating a table, make sure the column you assign as a primary key should uniquely identify each row.
---> If needed revisit the codes used to create tables for the gl_eats database.
